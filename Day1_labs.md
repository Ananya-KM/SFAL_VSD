# Day 1: Introduction to Verilog RTL design and Synthesis
### SIMULATOR
</p> A simulator is a tool used to verify and analyze the design of digital systems. Iverilog is one example of such a simulator.</p>

### DESIGN
</p> Design is the actual Verilog code which has the intended functionality to meet with the required specifications. </p>

### TESTBENCH
</p> Testbench is the setup to apply the stimulus(test_vectors) to the design to check its functionality. </p>

### How Does a Simulator Work?
</p> Simulator looks for changes on the input signals
Upon change to the input signal output is evaluated</p>
If no change to the input signal no change to output

## Note:
</p> Design may have one or more primary inputs, one or more primary outputs. </p>
Testbench does not have Primary input or primary outputs.

# Labs using iverilog and gtkwave
### LAB 1 -Tools Setup
#### To get started, clone the repository using the following command:


      git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git
    

</p> my_lib: This directory contains all the necessary library files. </p>
</p> lib: Here, youâ€™ll find the Sky130 standard cell library used for synthesis.</p>
</p> verilog_files: This folder holds the Verilog source files along with their corresponding testbench files. Each iverilog file is paired with its respective testbench.

## Lab 2: Introduction to iverilog gtkwave part1

Step 1: Navigate to the verilog_files directory.
#### Step 2: Load the design by executing the following command:

     iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v

A file called a.out is created

Step 3: Execute using ./a.out, it will dump the vcd file

Click on tb good mux, inputs and outputs signal will appear drag and drop them and click on Zoom fit.
