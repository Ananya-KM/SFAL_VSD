### 1. **Chip Modeling**
- **Define the Chip:** Start by writing a model in C that describes how the chip should behave. This helps make sure the idea works before building it.

### 2. **RTL Design**
- **Create RTL Code:** Convert the C model into RTL (Register Transfer Level) code using Verilog. This is like making a blueprint for the chip.

### 3. **Synthesis**
- **Turn RTL into Gates:** Change the RTL code into a gate-level design, which shows how the chip will be built using basic logic gates.

### 4. **SoC Integration**
- **Connect Everything:** Combine all the parts (processors, memory, etc.) into a single chip layout. This step involves organizing the chip's physical design.

### 5. **Floorplanning**
- **Final Layout:** Arrange the components on the chip and make sure all connections (wires) are correctly placed for efficient performance.

This flow helps create a functional and efficient chip from start to finish! </p>
