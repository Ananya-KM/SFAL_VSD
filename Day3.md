# Combinational and sequential optimizations
## Introduction to optimizations
## Combinational Logic Optimisation:
### Technique used for combinatinal optimisation:
#### 1.Constant propogation- Direct optimisation technique using boolean expression

**Basic Techniques:**
- **Sequential Constant Propagation:** This technique involves simplifying circuits by identifying outputs that remain constant regardless of the reset and clock signals.

**Advanced Techniques:**
- **State Optimization:** This process focuses on minimizing the number of states in a sequential circuit, improving efficiency and reducing complexity.
- **Retiming:** This involves rearranging the timing of registers in a circuit to enhance performance without altering the overall functionality.

**Additional Technique:**
- **Sequential Logic Cloning:** This refers to creating duplicate copies of sequential elements to optimize circuit performance and manage complexity.
